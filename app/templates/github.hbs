<h1>GitHub</h1>

<p>An essential for Web Developers.
    This actually took me a bit to learn and I still have a lot to learn about it and all the commands.
    Just a little story......... So as I am building THIS portfolio, I am branching out and pushing changes I have made in my code to the respective branches, all good and easy. 
    Well I made the mistake of trying to merge a branch to my master without being up to date with everything. At this point everything looked fine and I didn't even realize what I had done
    UNTIL I went to serve my master branch on localhost........EVERYTHING was back to the original code when I had just started.
    At this point I am freaking out!!! BUT Luckily (and this is why GitHub is so essential and a great tool) I was able to get everything back to normal. 
    The power of GitHub is amazing!
