  <p>Javascript is still very new to me. I have started my FreeCodeCamp Javascript Certificate and have set my deadline
    to finish. This one may take me a bit longer than my HTML and CSS courses, but I am looking forward to the
    challenges involved with learning Javascript and I love what you can accomplish with a solid knowledge of HTML, CSS
    and JS. I will become great at all three, that is my goal.</p>
