  <p>So let's talk about sketch. Sketch really helped me visualize what I wanted my site to look like. I had heard
    amazing things about it and purchased it as soon as I started coding, and I'll tell you what..... It lives up to its
    name. Sketch can do amazing things and although I'm getting good with it, I still have a lot to learn. That said I
    will continue to learn and use sketch with all my future projects. I made a great pixel perfect fav icon for an
    internship I'm doing with a company called Design Monster and they loved it! Design and layout is something that I
    am passionate about and Sketch has helped me begin to explore those aspects of becoming a developer. </p>
