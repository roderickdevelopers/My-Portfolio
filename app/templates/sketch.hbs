    <p>So let's talk about sketch. Sketch really helped me visualize what I wanted my site to look like. I heard amazing things about it and purchased it as soon as I started coding, and I'll tell you what..... It lives up to it's name. Sketch can do amazing things and I still have a lot to learn with it. That said I will continue to learn and use sketch with all my future projects. I made a great pixel perfect fav icon for an internship I'm doing with Design Monster with Sketch. </p>
