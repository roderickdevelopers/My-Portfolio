  <p>So let's talk about sketch. Sketch really helped me visualize what I wanted my site to look like. I heard amazing
    things about it and purchased it as soon as I started coding, and I'll tell you what..... It lives up to it's name.
    Sketch can do amazing things and I still have a lot to learn with it. That said I will continue to learn and use
    sketch with all my future projects. I made a great pixel perfect fav icon for an internship I'm doing with Design
    Monster with Sketch. </p>
