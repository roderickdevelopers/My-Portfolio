  <p>Contributing to open source has been a gratifying process! It has opened my eyes to working with a team and gaining
    that critical experience. I have worked on a few issues for The Ember Learning Team, and will be continuing to
    contribute to open source as much as I can to sharpen my skills. One of the best things I have done since starting
    coding is contributing to open source projects!</p>
