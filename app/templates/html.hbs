  <p>I started learning and playing 
    around with HTML through freeCodeCamp, 
    and from there I started learning more about
    HTMLBars within Ember.js. I still have lots to 
    learn but I have come further than I 
    ever thought I could in six
    months! I am working on mastering the proper structure and conventions
     of HTML and am interested in diving deeper
    into things like helpers and conditionals.</p>
