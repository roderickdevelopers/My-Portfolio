   <p>Java script is still very new to me. I have started my Free Code Camp Java Script Certificate and have set my deadline to finish. This one may take me a bit longer but I am a quick learner and I don't see it giving me to much of an issue. That being said I look forward to finishing it and starting on the next course to get my feet wet with Front End Libraries. </p>
