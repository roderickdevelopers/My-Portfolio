<div class="skills_body">
  <p>FreeCodeCamp was the beginning for me and I highly recommend it to any new coders that want to learn and feel
    accomplished after each lesson. I got my Certificate for Responsive Web Design and am currently working on my
    Javascript Certificate now. I will continue my learning with FreeCodeCamp as well as my internship at Design Monster
    and I know with hard work and dedication more opportunities will come my way! My goal is to finish all the courses.
