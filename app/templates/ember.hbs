    <p> I fell in love with Ember as soon as I started using it! Without ever having used a framework and having minimal coding knowledge, 
    I started building just a simple, SPA. It literally had one big picture, some links, and buttons that didn't function. I turned that 
    into the portfolio you are currently on. Ember's Discord channel is great and everyone in the Ember.js community is very friendly and 
    helpful. I would recommend Ember.js to anyone that's wants to make amazing things in a very user friendly environment. I was in the middle 
    of building this portfolio and signed up for a scholarship to the ember conference in Portland, Oregon, I was awarded a full scholarship with 
    a mentor and I am beyond excited!!!  I have been using ember now for about 6 months and this is my very first full project. Oh and by the way........ 
    Ember octane is amazing. Updated this project to ember octane as soon as it was released.  </p>
