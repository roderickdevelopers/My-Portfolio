  <p> I fell in love with Ember as soon as I started using it! Without ever having used a framework and having minimal
    coding knowledge,
    I started building just a simple SPA. It literally had one big picture, some links, and buttons that didn't
    function. I turned that
    into the portfolio you are currently on. Ember's Discord channel is great and everyone in the Ember.js community is
    very friendly and
    helpful. I would recommend Ember.js to anyone that's wants to make amazing things in a very user friendly
    environment. I was in the middle
    of building this portfolio and signed up for a scholarship to the ember conference in Portland, Oregon, I was
    awarded a full scholarship with
    a mentor and I am beyond excited!!! I have been using ember now for about 6 months and this is my very first full
    project. Oh and by the way........
    Ember octane is amazing. Updated this project to ember octane as soon as it was released. </p>
